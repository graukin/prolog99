There is a popular set of 99 prolog problems: https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems

I just want to solve them by myself :)

Project structure: 7 folders (1 per each task group), text file with all problems and .pl files with solutions (1 per problem). In .pl files first lines are filled with problem description.

Problems' types:
1. Prolog Lists
2. Arithmetic
3. Logic and Codes
4. Binary Trees
5. Multiway Trees
6. Graphs
7. Miscellaneous
